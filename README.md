# Presli
A passion project that started as a meme. It's made using DSharpPlus. Currently it can do basic things that I will share once I release it as a Docker image.
# Running the project
If you want to run it for yourself, you can do so by cloning the project in a directory of your choice. Once it's on your computer, edit the config.json file, run the code once with an IDE, then copy the config into the bin folder, and it should work fine.
